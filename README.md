# Hi, I'm Jeevan Merkaji Somanna👋🏼 👨🏽‍🎓 👨🏽‍💻 BW DE 👋

I'm a Software Developer by profession and a  machine learning researcher who is deeply interested in tinkering with neural networks, building data science projects, and gathering best practices of machine learning in production. I write often about theoretical deep learning and applied MLOps..

I solve problems and then post about them to help others.
